# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Solution

## Problem Identification
The original code violated the Single Responsibility Principle in the following ways:

1. The `CarManager` class had multiple responsibilities:
   - Database operations (getting cars from DB)
   - String formatting/presentation of car data
   - Business logic for finding the best car

This violates SRP because the class has multiple reasons to change:
- Changes to database operations
- Changes to how cars are displayed
- Changes to the best car selection criteria

## Solution
The code was refactored by splitting the `CarManager` class into three specialized classes:

1. `CarRepository` - Handles database operations
2. `CarFormatter` - Handles string formatting and presentation
3. `CarRanker` - Handles business logic for car comparison and selection

This separation ensures that each class has a single responsibility and a single reason to change.
